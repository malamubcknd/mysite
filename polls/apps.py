"""The code you provided defines a configuration class for a Django app named "polls." This configuration 
class, PollsConfig, is part of Django's app configuration system and is typically located in the apps.py 
file of the app's directory. Let's break down this code:

    Import Statement:
        from django.apps import AppConfig: This line imports the AppConfig class from Django's apps 
        module. AppConfig is the base class for creating configuration classes for Django apps.

    PollsConfig Class:

        PollsConfig is a custom configuration class for the "polls" app. It inherits from AppConfig, 
        indicating that it's a configuration class for an app.

        default_auto_field: This attribute specifies the default primary key field used for model 
        auto-generation. In this case, it's set to 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'. This means that 
        new models created in this app will use a BigAutoField as their primary key by default. 
        The BigAutoField is a 64-bit integer field suitable for large databases.

        name: This attribute specifies the name of the app, which is set to "polls." It's important to 
        match the actual name of the app directory to avoid confusion.

This configuration class provides settings and metadata for the "polls" app, including the default 
primary key field type for new models within the app. While the code you provided is relatively minimal,
 it's a standard practice to include such app configuration classes in Django projects to centralize 
 app-specific settings and metadata. These classes can be used to customize app behavior and integrate 
 it with the overall project configuration."""
